Bikes last used:
Find the last time each bike was in use. Output both the bike number and the date-timestamp of the bike's last use (i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). Order the results by bikes that were most recently used

Solution 1:
dc_bikeshare_q1_2012 = dc_bikeshare_q1_2012.groupBy("bike_number").agg(max(col("end_time")).alias("last_time"))\
                    .orderBy(desc("last_time"))
